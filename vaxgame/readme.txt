This folder contains code that was adapted from https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/VaxGame  

At one point the code at https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/VaxGame was being hosted at 
http://vax.herokuapp.com but at some point in 2022 that site stopped working (presumably with
the elimination of the heroku free tier).

In Ohio, we were using the game as a part of a high school math course, and there was some
funding available so a web developer named Kaden Mull (http://github.com/kmull99) was able
to refactor the code so that it no longer relied on ruby on rails. Now the code can run on
github pages or any other hosting service potentially for free. Removing ruby on rails does not
remove any features of the game (all the action was already in javascript) and it helps
to make the site more resistant to "bit rot" moving forward.

The code was originally released by https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/VaxGame 
on a Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license. The code was developed by
Marcel Salathé and collaborators.

The code in this directory is live at http://stemcodingohio.github.io/vaxgame/

Enjoy! And a big thank you to the Salathé group for developing this activity!
