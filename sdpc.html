<p><b>What is the Student Data Privacy Consortium?</b>
  
<p>Many states have laws that govern K12 student data, and govern the behavior of entities that have access to that data. Increasingly, districts are operating with guidelines that sites that require student log-ins should be assumed to be off-limits unless or until it can be vetted and an agreement with the owners of the site worked out, which is understandable given the need to protect student data.
</p>

<p>An organization that has responded to this situation where there is a need both to protect student data but also to make straightfoward the task of vettting educational software and websites that students would potentially use is the <a href="https://privacy.a4l.org/">Student Data Privacy Consortium</a>. The short version of this note is simply that <a href="http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com">stemcoding.herokuapp.com</a> is a registered site with the Student Data Privacy consortium. </p>

<p><b>What does it mean that stemcoding.herokuapp.com is a registered site with the Student Data Privacy Consortium?</b></p>

<p>Specifically this means that at least one district has signed a data privacy agreement with STEMcoding Education Ohio to allow use of stemcoding.herokuapp.com in their schools using the template provided by the Student Data Privacy Consortium. This does not mean that stemcoding.herokuapp.com is approved for your school but it means that a template exists </p>
