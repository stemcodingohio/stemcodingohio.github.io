<p>The STEMcoding LMS uses source code that was originally developed by software engineers at Ohio State University. The site https://stemcoding.herokuapp.com is actually a mirror site of https://stemcoding.osu.edu which was developed in 2017 to serve OSU students and staff. Through a licensing agreement in 2020 with Ohio State University the non-profit STEMcoding Education Ohio was permitted to use this same source code for the purposes of creating a mirror site (http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com)

<p>The software used in the STEMcoding LMS is secure and the team at Ohio State that originally developed it followed established best practices to ensure that reasonable precautions are made to protect this data from unauthorized access.

<p>Teachers can register for the site and set up a class. If we see that students have joined the class we will send a paypal invoice to the teacher email. This invoice will be from STEMcoding Education Ohio.


<p><b>How student data will be protected:</b>

<p>We have not in the past, not currently, nor in the future do we plan to use the student data on http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com in an educational research study. The only research study that has been conducted in connection to our site was a situation where both the teachers and students were made aware that they were part of an education reeseach study and the study design was approved by a university.
  
<p>We have not in the past, not currently, nor in the future do we plan to sell or provide any of the student data (for example names and email addresses) to another party for any purpose. For example, students will NOT receive any kind of college recruitment emails as a result of their use of http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com
