<p>The STEMcoding Learning Management System (STEMcoding LMS) is a website (hosted at http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com) that is owned and operated by the non-profit STEMcoding Education Ohio. This non-profit was founded by Dr. Chris Orban and Dr. Richelle Teeling-Smith. 

  
  <p><b>By using this website, you agree to the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy.</b>
  
<p>The STEMcoding LMS uses source code that was developed by software engineers at Ohio State University. The site https://stemcoding.herokuapp.com is actually a mirror site of https://stemcoding.osu.edu which was developed in 2017 to serve OSU students and staff. Through a licensing agreement in 2020 with Ohio State University the non-profit STEMcoding Education Ohio was permitted to use this same source code for the purposes of creating a mirror site (http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com)

<p>The software used in the STEMcoding LMS is secure and the team at Ohio State that developed it follows established best practices to ensure that reasonable precautions are made to protect this data from unauthorized access.

<p>The STEMcoding LMS is hosted on the popular heroku platform with database info stored on amazon web services. The only individual with access to this data is Dr. Chris Orban and Dr. Richelle Teeling-Smith.

<p>To be clear, STEMcoding Education Ohio and the STEMcoding LMS is not a registered minors program of Ohio State University. STEMcoding Education Ohio is a registered non-profit organization in the state of Ohio that is separate from these universities except for the licensing agreement with Ohio State University for the source code.

<p><b>Costs:</b>

<p>Teachers who use the site will be charged about $20 per year. The actual cost is about $1 more than $20 because of online payment charges. Student use of the site is free and teachers can enroll as many students as they like.

<p>Teachers can register for the site and set up a class. If we see that students have joined the class we will send a paypal invoice to the teacher email for $20. This invoice will be from STEMcoding Education Ohio.


<p><b>How student data will be protected:</b>

<p>We have not in the past, not currently, nor in the future do we plan to use the student data on http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com in an educational research study. If we were going to perform an educational research study it would need to be approved by Ohio State University (OSU) and they would require us to use stemcoding.osu.edu (which is hosted on OSU servers) instead of stemcoding.herokuapp.com to perform this study.

<p>We have not in the past, not currently, nor in the future do we plan to sell or provide any of the student data (for example names and email addresses) to another party for any purpose. For example, students will NOT receive any kind of college recruitment emails as a result of their use of http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com  At present the only use of these email addresses is if students forget their password and request an email to reset their password. There are also features planned to send students emails when their code submissions are reviewed by their teacher, or if an assignment due date is coming up. These are the only uses of the email addresses that the student provides.

<p>Because we are running and maintaining the site ourselves (rather than pay someone to do this at substantial cost) we are able to keep our expenses low. Also, we are incorporated as a non-profit because we are not interested in a profit-maximizing model. The $20 per year per teacher model is enough for us to cover our expenses in running the site and the non-profit.
